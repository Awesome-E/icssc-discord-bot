    1. this invalidates snipes where you, say, become mutually aware of one another and then snipe behind your back immediately
4. the victim must be identifiable (e.g. face)
5. the camera device must not be worn; other worn devices such as the apple watch shutter feature are acceptable
6. absolutely do not snipe anyone without consent
